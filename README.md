# ComputerOrganization

This code was the basis for my Computer Organization class in the Spring of 2020, wherein we discussed and practiced digital logic, how processors work, assembly code, and the general workings of computers at a low level.

Most files consist of starter code, provided by the professor, which was then edited, added to, or fixed by me for the assignment. Some later labs consist of a .c file and a .asm file. In these cases, the C code was provided and meant to be rewritten completely in assembly.
